   State repression of civil society organizations, in particular NGOs, has become ubiquitous over the last few decades. Besides undertaking violence towards costly organizations, states have also increasingly used legislation to crack down on NGOs. By creating barriers to their entry, funding, and operations, these laws restrict the space available for NGOs to engage in advocacy and provide services. How do such legal restrictions on NGOs impact private donors? With decreasing funding for NGOs working in contentious issue areas, and a lack of philanthropic culture in many developing countries, numerous NGO rely on funds from private donors in Western countries. Using an innovative survey experiment, we look at the impact of state repression of NGOs on the preferences of private donors. In particular, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors preferences and behavior based on the issue area of the organization, and the main source of its funds. WE FIND. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the sustainability of civil society organizations in developing countries.

The January 2011 Egyptian uprisings against the Mubarak regime presented a window of opportunity for Egypt's NGOs to transform themselves into agents of democracy. Human rights organizations ramped up their work while many development NGOs embarked on projects related to politics, policy, and social change. However, just as NGOs started to take advantage of new levels of public engagement and civic freedoms, a new legislation was passed. This 2014 legislation allowed the government to block funding for NGOs and deny any requests to affiliate with international organizations, accusing such organizations of, "grand treason, conspiracy against Egypt, and carrying out foreign agendas to harm Egyptian national security." Consequently, many international donor agencies cut support for Egyptian NGOs out of concern that they would be accused of offering illegal support for NGOs [@Brechenmacher:2017]. Such developments are not limited to Egypt and have been mirrored in many other countries across the developing world, such as India, Bolivia, and Hungary, to name a few. Between the lack of a local philanthropic culture towards these rights-based groups and the suspension of official state funds from abroad, many NGOs across developing countries are now completely dependent on private foreign donors. But how do private donors feel about donating to beseiged NGOs abroad? How do such legal restrictions on NGOs impact private donors? 

Using an innovative survey experiment, we look at the impact of state repression of NGOs on the preferences of private donors, as well as their actual behavior donating to besieged NGOs. In particular, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors' preferences and behavior based on the issue area of the organization, and the main source of its funds. We explore how this opinion varies based on whether a recipient nonprofit (1) faces legal restrictions or a government crackdown on its activities, (2) works on particular issues, such as humanitarian assistance or human rights advocacy, and (3) receives its funding from government or private sources. 

INSERT FINDINGS

This question is important for three main reasons. First, while an increasingly large amount of private philanthropy is directed towards civil society groups in developing countries, there is little research on the structural-level determinants of such giving. In 2010, U.S. philanthropy to developing countries exceeded U.S official development assistance (ODA) by almost $9 billion. By 2014, U.S. private philanthropy amounted to $43.9 billion - %15 billion of which went to international affairs. By 2016, this amount directed towards civil society groups working in international affairs increased to $22.03 billion [@givingusa:2017]. While a substantive literature exists on understanding ODA and foreign aid to developing countries, we know little about the structural-level determinants of the factors that motivate ordinary individuals to donate to causes in foreign countries. 

Second, a number of NGOs working in developing countries rely on funds from private donors in Western countries. This is because governments of such countries often provide funding only for groups working in non-contentious issue areas. Further, in places where local philanthropic capacity exists, it is often directed towards charitable activities such as health, education or religious services, rather than rights or policy work that Western aid providers generally sponsor [@Carothers:2015]. Even when domestic donors wish to donate to NGOs working in contentious areas, they are often deterred by dismal tax incentives, or threats by governments to take away business permits. Therefore, NGOs abroad are forced to rely on private donors abroad.

Finally, understanding these structural-level factors of individual giving can be used to formulate policy to ensure that such organizations continue to function in many countries where they are under attacked. NGOs play an important role in consolidating democratic gains made through contentious politics and preventing reversals to authoritarian rule [@odonnellschmitter; @Diamond:1987]. They also help inculcate democratic values and encourage civic participation [@putnam2000]. Without continued access to private funds, many groups abroad may cease to operate or to change their mission to focus on issue areas that are more compatible with government preferences.

Below, we first review existing literature on determinants of charitable-giving, highlighting the reasons why NGOs in developing countries are so reliant on foreign funds and why this funding is in jeopardy. We then elaborate on our expectations regarding private donor giving to beseiged NGOs abroad. Following this, we describe our online survey experiment. After presenting an analysis of the results, we outline the implications of our findings for NGOs abroad, as well as domestic NGOs and foundations engaging in private philanthropy.


# Private philanthropy towards NGOs: Causes and Obstacles

The vast majority of literature on charitable-giving focuses on individual-level determinants of philanthropy. In contrast, our study looks at the structural-level conditions that inhibit or encourage giving by ordinary citizens[^1]. As governments continue to increase legal restrictions on NGOs and other CSOs, the effect of these structural-level conditions may trump individual-level causes [^2]. Below, we first review these individual-level determinants of philanthropy, followed by an explanation of why private philanthropy is essential to the operation of NGOs across the developing world.

## Who donates to NGOs and why

Recent work by @bekkers2011literature has identified eight mechanisms for why people donate to charity. These mechanisms include - awareness of need, solicitation, costs and benefits, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values, and efficacy. Others have focused on the organization and mission of the NGOs, arguing that specialized NGOs attract higher private donations than highly diversified NGOs since the former's activities would align best with donor preferences [@bilodeau1997]. Finally, looking at individual-level determinants, @Wiepking:2010 finds that NGOs with an international focus are more likely to receive donations from people who are older, religious, left-leaning. 

Despite the wide range of motivations that drive individuals' philanthropic habits, these studies overall find low levels of giving to overseas causes or international groups [@Micklewright:2009, @Rajan:2009, Atkinson et al 2012, @CasaleBaumann:2015]. As @casalebaumann point out, only a small proportion of private donors donate to international charity because the number of recipients are often so large and generally far removed the donor. Therefore, the benefits of giving are less obvious compared to donating to a domestic charity. However, @KnowlesSullivan:2017 argue that these studies find a preference for giving to domestic charities,simply than because there are more domestic charities than international development charities, which overall does not constitute eveidence that people preferred to give to local causes. 

Recent experimental evidence, however, does fall in line with the expectation of the above studies that private donors are less likely to give to international NGOs. Based on an online survey experiment of 1,200 individuals, @Tremblay-BoirePrakash:2016 find that donors are more likely to donate to a charity operating locally than to a charity providing an identical service abroad.  Knowles and Sullivan (2017), based on a field experiment in New Zealand, similarly find that 71.6% of participants reveal a preference for giving to a local charity, Salvation Army, rather than the international development charity, World Vision.

While the above studies provide deep insight into the individual-level determinants of donating to NGOs, our study attempts to evlauate structural-level determinants that prohibit or encourage giving. Individuals can be motivated to engage in philanthropy; however, if NGOs of their choice are prevented from operating, or the target countries are engaging in a crackdown towards NGOs, these individuals may be deterred. An understanding of the effects of structural-level causes can also shed light on how they influence individual-level determinants of giving. For instance, private philanthropy towards beseiged NGOs is perhaps most in line with the two mechanisms outlined by @bekkers2011literature on why individuals donate to charities - values and efficacy. Donating to beseiged groups may feed into individual donors' perception of saving civil society by a government assualt, whereas efficacy would fit in with donors' belief that their donation will make a real difference since the NGO may not be able to survive without such donations. Thus, our study also lays the foundation for future scholarship on the interaction of individual and structural-level determinants of philanthropy.

## NGO Dependence on Foreign Funds in Developing Countries 

Across many parts of the developing world, NGOs or CSOs are dependent on foreign funds for their operations for a variety of reasons. First, citizens in many developing countries are too poor to support a local NGO community. Without the provision of foreign aid, it may be impossible for this sector to sustain itself. Second, even for countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable-giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90% of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America [@DPR:2015]. Third, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions.

However, a number of states across the globe have increasingly placed restrictions on funding for nonprofits, especially from ODA and foundation sources. These can include various forms - this includes requirements that funds be routed through state-owned banks, abolishing tax incentives for corporations, mandating that funds from foreign sources cannot be donated towards 'political' causes [^3], and in the most extreme cases, completely prohibiting NGOs to accept any funds from foreign sources.

These restrictions have had dire consequences for nonprofits across many parts of the world. For instance, in 2011, 30,000 NGOs were registered in Egypt - 60 of which were explicitly working on the issue of human rights and were funded exclusively by international donors [@Elagati:2013]. However, once Egypt began to target foreign groups such as the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center and other state and foundation sources, there was a decrease in foreign funding. Since then, private Egyptian groups, which initially attempted to fill the gap left by the the decreases in foreign funding, have been less willing to fund any projects that could attract the ire of the government [@Brechenmacher:2017, 330].

In other parts of the world, a lack of tax incentives for domestic donors makes nonprofits increasingly reliant on foreign private donors. For instance, as the Hudson Institute's Index of Philanthropic Freedom (2015) elaborates, in Lebanon, corporate donors can get a tax deduction of only up to a maximum of $10. The 2011 Act in Hungary abolished tax incentives for individuals. Finally, in Ecuador, Decree 16 in 2013 mandated that domestic donors had no tax incentives. 

More systematically, Chaudhry and Heiss (2018) use original data on civil society restrictions across 148 countries from 1981–2013 to assess the impact of these restrictions on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. They find that anti-NGO legal barriers—in particular, barriers to advocacy—decrease the amount of foreign channeled to restrictive countries. Besides reducing the amount of aid, government donors also redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Finally, donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic over foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics.

Therefore, between restrictions on official state and foundation funding sources, as well as restrictions on domestic giving, many nonprofits across the developing world are becoming increasingly dependent on private foreign sources. 


# Theory and Hypotheses

As shown above, while charitable-giving by individual, private donors has increased over time, the decision regarding which charity to donate to is often not a major financial decision for individual donors. While a number of indicators such as Charity Navigator are available to help identify trustworthy NGOs, many donors may not scrutinize such indicators or tax documents before making their decisions (Szper and Prakash 2011, Tremblay-Boire and Prakash 2017). Rather, they identify groups based on various other metrics such as issue area, organizational values, whether the groups pursues interests related to personal values, and seeking information from friends, family, and acquaintances (Szper and Prakash 2011, Sloan 2009). 

In this paper, we test one primary hypothesis and two secondary hypotheses, related to both the amount donated and the likelihood that someone will donate.

First, we expect that government restrictions abroad will increase the likelihood of donation and the amounts donated. This is because such restrictions don't necessarily impact organizational values. Rather, donors see more efficient use of their funds and may be driven to donate more.

> **H~1a~**:  Donors will give more to NGOs that face legal crackdowns abroad.
> 
> **H~1b~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to NGOs that face legal crackdowns abroad.

Second, we aim to see how the likelihood and amounts of donation vary with the issue area in question. In this experiment, we primarily look at two issue areas - human rights and humanitarian issues (explanation provided below in the methods section). We expect that people are more likely to donate to humanitarian causes because it is seen as uncontroversial and is often expected to be apolitical and directed towards emergency relief in life-threatening circumstances. On the other hand, human rights may often be seen as politically motivated, especially when concentrating on work such as state-sanctioned abuses. It can also be viewed as divisive since it often attempts to change popular prejudices and discriminatory attitudes that threaten rights of marginalized and unpopular social groups [@Crowther:2015]. 

> **H~2a~**:  Donors will give more to NGOs working on humanitarian issues.
> 
> **H~2b~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to NGOs working on humanitarian issues.

Finally, we look at how the source of funding influences the amount of likelihood of donate. We expect both of these to increase if the NGOs in question typically get more funds from private donors rather than governments.

> **H~3a~**:  Donors will give more to NGOs that do not receive substantial funding from government sources.
> 
> **H~3b~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to NGOs that do not receive substantial funding from government sources.

# Methods
To test the above hypotheses, we conducted an online (pilot?) survey experiment of 542 individuals in the U.S. We focus in particular on the use of this experiment because most panel data does not ask questions about or include charities that have an international focus (Knowles and Sullivan 2017). Our methodology allows us to vary certain elements of NGOs in order to explore the role of specific factors that motivate philanthropic action by individuals.

To recruit respondents, we used the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform[^MTURK]. Prior to being exposed to the experiment,

##Descriptive Statistics


# Results and Analysis

## Caveats

Since this survey focuses on donations by citizens rather than institutional donors, it is not reflective of the average donor dollar. However, it is important to note that Americans are driving much of this private philanthropy. As Runde (2017) points out, "U.S. philanthropy is significant; but it is mainly Ms. Smith and Mr. Johnson. Not Mr. and Mrs. Gates."

Not a representative sample - how does our sample differ from the general population? What does general donor sample look like?


# Discussion

While the number of NGOs proliferated across the globe with the end of the Cold War, we are no longer at a historic high in terms of support for such civil society organizations. Numerous countries have cracked down on funding from foreign governments for domestic NGOs. Further, between the lack of a local philanthropic culture and an increasingly authoritarian approach that restricts space for domestic philanthropy, many NGOs are forced to rely on foreign private donors. But how do such donors donate to beseiged NGOs abroad? Using a survey experiment of 524 individuals across the United States, WE FIND. 

Our results have important implications for understanding donor behavior, as well as for the sustainability of civil society organizations in developing countries. INSERT IMPLICATIONS FOR DONOR BEHAVIOR.
 
The above results also make us optimistic about the prospects for substainability of domestic civil society organizations abroad. Even if these groups operate in countries that restrict funding from foreign governments, these groups can adapt their organizational structures in a way that makes them more resistant to government reperesssion. One way to do that is by transitioning to membership-based models. For instance, in India, organizations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace are registered as domestic organizations that aim to fundraise domestically after restrictions on foreign government funding. Such organizations can even fundraise from private donors in neighboring countries in order to overcome restrictions on official aid. Futher, since private funders tend to be less kown by people in recipient countries compared to major governmental funders, such methods of funding are less likely to attract the ire of authoritarian governments.
