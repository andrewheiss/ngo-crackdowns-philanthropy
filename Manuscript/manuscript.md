    State repression of civil society organizations—in particular NGOs—has become ubiquitous in recent decades. Besides undertaking violence towards costly organizations, states have also increasingly used legislation to crack down on NGOs. By creating barriers to their entry, funding, and operations, these laws restrict the space available for NGOs to engage in advocacy and provide services. How do these legal restrictions on NGOs impact patterns of private philanthropic giving and individual donor decision making? With decreasing funding for NGOs working in contentious issue areas, and a lack of philanthropic culture in many developing countries, numerous NGO rely on funds from private donors in Western countries. Using an innovative survey experiment, we test the impact of state repression of NGOs on the preferences of private donors. In particular, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors preferences and behavior based on the issue area of the organization, and the main source of its funds. We find that legal crackdowns on NGOs have a moderate effect on the probability that a donor gives money, with a significant positive effect in only one condition—donors are more likely to donate to privately funded human rights NGOs that are legally besieged. While crackdowns do not have a strong effect on the likelihood to donate, we find that already-likely donors tend to give substantially more to legally restricted NGOs, in particular those that work on humanitarian issues generally, privately-funded human rights organizations, and government-funded humanitarian organizations. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the sustainability of civil society organizations in developing countries.

The January 2011 Egyptian uprisings against the Mubarak regime presented a window of opportunity for Egyptian NGOs to transform themselves into agents of democracy. Domestic human rights organizations ramped up their work while many development NGOs embarked on projects related to politics, policy, and social change. However, just as NGOs started to take advantage of new levels of public engagement and civic freedoms, both the interim military regime and Mohamed Morsi's regime proposed new legislation designed to restrict funding for Egyptian NGOs and deny any requests to affiliate with foreign NGOs, accusing such organizations of "grand treason, conspiracy against Egypt, and carrying out foreign agendas to harm Egyptian national security" [@hrw:2011]. Though these proposed restrictions were not officially passed and ratified until 2017, between 2012–2017, many international donor agencies cut support for Egyptian NGOs out of concern that they would be accused of offering illegal support for domestic civil society organizations [@Brechenmacher:2017]. This legal constriction of funding for NGOs is not limited to Egypt, and many other countries have followed suit, including India, Bolivia, Hungary, China, and Russia. Between the lack of a local philanthropic culture towards these rights-based groups and the suspension of official state funds from abroad, many NGOs across developing countries are now completely dependent on private foreign donors. But how do individual donors feel about donating to legally beseiged NGOs abroad? How do these legal restrictions on NGOs impact private donors? 

These questions are important for three main reasons. First, while an increasingly large amount of private philanthropy is directed towards civil society groups in developing countries, there is little research on the structural determinants of such giving. In 2010, US philanthropy to developing countries exceeded US official development assistance (ODA) by almost \$9 billion. By 2014, US private philanthropy amounted to \$43.9 billion, \$15 billion of which was given towards international causes. By 2016, the amount directed towards civil society groups working in international affairs increased to \$22.03 billion [@givingusa:2017]. While a substantive literature exists on understanding state-based ODA and foreign aid to developing countries, we know little about the factors that motivate ordinary individuals to donate to causes in foreign countries. 

Second, a number of NGOs working in developing countries rely on funds from private donors in Western countries, in part because domestic government grants often provide funding only for NGOs working in non-contentious issues such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, or international development, lest the work of human rights NGOs threaten regime stability [@Chaudhry:2016; @Heiss:2017]. Further, in places where local philanthropic capacity exists, it is often directed towards charitable activities such as health, education, or religious services, rather than rights or policy work that Western aid providers generally sponsor [@Carothers:2015]. Even when domestic donors wish to donate to NGOs working in contentious areas, they are often deterred by dismal tax incentives or threats by governments to take away business permits. Consequently, domestic NGOs in foreign countries are forced to rely on private donors abroad.

Finally, an understanding of the structural factors of individual giving can be used to formulate policy to ensure that such organizations continue to function in many countries where they are under attack. NGOs play an important role in consolidating democratic gains made through contentious politics and preventing reversals to authoritarian rule [@odonnellschmitter; @Diamond:1987]. They also help inculcate democratic values and encourage civic participation [@putnam2000]. Without continued access to private funds, many groups abroad may cease to operate or to change their mission to focus on issue areas that are more compatible with government preferences [@Heiss:2017].

Given these reasons, we use an innovative survey experiment to measure the impact of state repression of NGOs on the preferences and behavior of private donors. In particular, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors' preferences and behavior based on whether a recipient NGO (1) faces legal restrictions or a government crackdown on its activities, (2) works on particular issues, such as humanitarian assistance or human rights advocacy, and (3) receives its funding from government or private sources. We find that donors are generally responsive to the legal difficulties international NGOs face abroad and tend to do be more likely to donate to beseiged NGOs. In particular, our results show that donors are more likely to donate to privately funded human rights NGOs facing crackdowns. While crackdowns do not have a strong effect on the likelihood to donate, we find that already-likely donors tend to give more to legally restricted NGOs. On average, study participants increased their donations to beseiged NGOs by 19% and gave considerably more under other conditions—donors gave 25% more to restricted humanitarian NGOs, 42% more to restricted privately-funded human rights NGOs, and a substantial 67% more to restricted government-funded human rights NGOs.  

Below, we first review existing literature on determinants of charitable-giving, highlighting the reasons why NGOs in developing countries are so reliant on foreign funds and why this funding is in jeopardy. We then elaborate on our expectations regarding private donor giving to legally beseiged NGOs abroad. Following this, we describe our online survey experiment, present our analysis of the results, and outline the implications of our findings both for recipient NGOs abroad and for donor NGOs and foundations engaged in private philanthropy.


# Private philanthropy to NGOs: Causes and obstacles

The vast majority of literature on charitable giving focuses on individual-level determinants of philanthropy. In contrast, our study looks at the structural-level conditions that inhibit or encourage giving by ordinary citizens.[^1a] As governments continue to increase legal restrictions on NGOs and other CSOs, the effect of these structural-level conditions may override individual-level causes.[^2a] Below, we first review these individual-level determinants of philanthropy and then explore why private philanthropy is essential to the operation of NGOs across the developing world.

## Who donates to NGOs and why?

Recent work by @BekkersWiepking:2011 has identified eight mechanisms for why people donate to charity: awareness of need, solicitation, costs and benefits, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values, and efficacy. Others have focused on the organization and mission of the NGOs, arguing that specialized NGOs attract higher private donations than highly diversified NGOs since the former's activities would align best with donor preferences [@BilodeauSlivinski:1997]. Finally, looking at individual-level determinants, @Wiepking:2010 finds that NGOs with an international focus are more likely to receive donations from people who are older, religious, and left-leaning. 

Despite the wide range of motivations that drive individuals' philanthropic habits, these studies overall find low levels of giving to overseas causes or international groups [@Micklewright:2009; @Rajan:2009; @AtkinsonBackusMicklewright:2012; @CasaleBaumann:2015]. As @CasaleBaumann:2015 point out, only a small proportion of private donors donate to international charity because the number of recipients are often so large and generally far removed the donor. Therefore, the benefits of giving are less obvious compared to donating to a domestic charity. However, @KnowlesSullivan:2017 argue that these studies find a preference for giving to domestic charities simply than because there are more domestic charities than international development charities, which overall does not constitute eveidence that people preferred to give to local causes. 

Recent experimental evidence, however, does fall in line with the expectation of the above studies that private donors are less likely to give to international NGOs. Based on an online survey experiment of 1,200 individuals, @Tremblay-BoirePrakash:2017 find that donors are more likely to donate to a charity operating locally than to a charity providing an identical service abroad. @KnowlesSullivan:2017, based on a field experiment in New Zealand, similarly find that 71.6% of participants reveal a preference for giving to a local charity, Salvation Army, rather than an international development charity, World Vision.

While these studies provide deep insight into the individual-level determinants of donating to NGOs, our study attempts to evlauate structural-level determinants that prohibit or encourage giving. Individuals may be privately motivated to engage in philanthropy—however, if NGOs of their choice are prevented from operating, or if NGO target countries engage in a legal crackdown of NGOs, donors can be deterred from actually donating. An understanding of the effects of structural factors can also shed light on how they influence individual-level determinants of giving. For instance, two of the mechanisms identified by @BekkersWiepking:2011—values and efficacy—align closely with the likelihood of donating to legally restricted NGOs. Donating to beseiged organizations may feed into individual donors' perception of saving civil society by a government assualt, playing on donors' values, while donating out of a belief that their assistance could make a real difference for the NGO since the organization may not be able to survive without such donations is connected to donors' preferences for efficacy. Thus, our study also lays a foundation for future scholarship on the interaction of individual and structural-level determinants of philanthropy.

## NGO dependence on foreign funds in developing countries 

Across many parts of the developing world, domestic NGOs are dependent on foreign funds for a variety of reasons. First, citizens in many developing countries are too poor to support a local NGO community, and without the support of foreign aid, it may be impossible for a civil society sector to sustain itself. Second, even in countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90% of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America [@DPR:2015]. Third, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions.

However, a number of states across the globe have increasingly placed restrictions on funding for nonprofits, especially from ODA and foundation sources. These can include various forms, including requirements that funds be routed through state-owned banks, the abolition of tax incentives for corporations, mandates that funds from foreign sources cannot be donated towards "political" causes,[^3a] and in the most extreme cases, completely prohibitions against NGOs accepting any funds from foreign sources.

These restrictions have had dire consequences for nonprofits across many parts of the world. In 2011, 30,000 NGOs were registered in Egypt, 60 of which were explicitly focused on human rights issues and funded exclusively by international donors [@Elagati:2013]. However, once post-revolutionary Egypt began to target foreign groups such as the National Democratic Institute, the Carter Center, and other state and foundation sources, foreign funding to Egyptian NGOs dropped sharply. Since the imposition of these anti-foreign funding restrictions, private Egyptian donors and foundations—which initially attempted to fill the gap left by the the decreases in foreign funding—have been less willing to fund any projects that could attract the ire of the government, and domestic Egyptian NGOs have suffered financially [@Brechenmacher:2017, 330].

In other parts of the world, an absence of tax incentives for domestic donors makes nonprofits increasingly reliant on foreign private donors. For instance, as the Hudson Institute's Index of Philanthropic Freedom [-@HudsonInstitute:2015] elaborates, in Lebanon, corporate donors can get a tax deduction of only up to a maximum of $10. Legislation in 2011 in Hungary abolished tax incentives for individual donors, and in Ecuador, Decree 16 of 2013 mandated that individual donors would no receive tax incentives for philanthropic giving.

More systematically, @ChaudhryHeiss:2018 use original data on civil society restrictions across 148 countries from 1981–2013 to assess the impact of these restrictions on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. They find that anti-NGO legal barriers—in particular, barriers to advocacy—decrease the amount of foreign channeled to restrictive countries. Besides reducing the amount of aid, government donors also redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Finally, state-based donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic over foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics.

Therefore, between restrictions on official state and foundation funding sources, as well as restrictions on domestic giving, many nonprofits across the developing world are becoming increasingly dependent on private foreign sources. 


# Theory and hypotheses

As explained above, while there is a substantial body of work exploring the individual determinants of private giving, there is little research on the structural factors that influence why someone would donate to an NGO. Institutions and other structural-level factors fall lie outside individual preferences and control, but can still exert considerable influence over donors. In theory, perfectly rational donors would scrutinize nonprofit tax documents and bylaws prior to donation and ensure that the organization's values align with their own, but this in-depth individual-level analysis rarely occurs in practice [@SzperPrakash:2011; @Tremblay-BoirePrakash:2017]. Instead, donors often rely on shortcuts and heuristics to determine the trustworthiness of nonprofit organizations. For example, the existence of voluntary regulatory and accountability programs or financial reporting institutions such as Charity Navigator allows donors to identify trustworthy NGOs based on criteria set forth by these watchdog organizations. Donors will also make cursory judgements about an organization's issue area, mission, vision, and values and seek out supplementary information from friends, family, and acquaintances [@SzperPrakash:2011; @Sloan:2009]. NGO geographies serve as an additional institutional heuristics for NGO trustworthiness. @Tremblay-BoirePrakash:2017 find that although nonprofit membership in voluntary accountability programs has little effect on willingness to donate, the location of NGO operations does matter, with donors more likely to give to local organizations than international organizations. National contexts can also influence donor perceptions of deservingness. In a vignette-based survey experiment, @AndorferOtte:2012 find that donors are more likely to donate to disaster relief NGOs in countries with the greatest need, choosing to donate more to hypothetical disasters in Bangladesh and Romana than in Switzerland or Romania.

In this paper, we argue that domestic politics in the countries where international NGOs operate can thus have a direct influence on donor behavior at home. This influence also interacts with NGO missions and funding to create a more nuanced description of the structural factors behind philanthropic giving. We propose that the presence of legal crackdowns abroad can serve as yet another structural signal of NGO trustworthiness and deservingness. Legal restrictions convey to donors that NGOs undertake important, confrontational, and effective work. Accordingly, we expect that government restrictions abroad will increase the likelihood of donation and the amounts donated, thus yielding two versions of our first hypothesis:

> **H~1a~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to NGOs that face legal crackdowns abroad.
> 
> **H~1b~**:  Donors will give more to NGOs that face legal crackdowns abroad.

We also propose that legal crackdowns correlate and interact with other structural factors that relate to the likelihood that an NGO is legally besieged abroad. As described previously, the ongoing global crackdown on NGOs is based in part on regime fears of Western expansion, and the laws that have been passed are generally designed to restrict funds from foreign government to more contentious human rights focused organizations. As such, in this experiment we look at the connection between legal crackdown, NGO issue areas, and NGO funding sources. NGO missions and issue areas serve as an effective structural heuristic for donors. We expect that donors will be more likely to donate to humanitarian causes because these are seen as uncontroversial, apolitical, and directed towards the most deserving of need, such as emergency relief in life-threatening circumstances. On the other hand, human rights organizations can often be seen as politically motivated, especially when concentrating on work such as state-sanctioned abuse. This work is also contentious since it often attempts to change popular prejudices and discriminatory attitudes that threaten rights of marginalized and unpopular social groups [@Crowther:2015]. We expect that crackdowns abroad will amplify donor affinity for humanitarian NGOs, leading to two versions of our second hypothesis:

> **H~2a~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to legally besieged NGOs working on humanitarian issues.
> 
> **H~2b~**:  Donors will give more to legally besieged NGOs working on humanitarian issues.

Finally, we argue that the source of NGOs funding should influence donor behavior. It is unlikely that most donors are aware that the legal environment for international NGOs is increasingly hostile towards organizations receiving foreign government funding, but the distinction between private and government funding can nonetheless signal an organization's deservingness. We expect that donors who see that organizations are privately funded will feel that they can also contribute and help, while donors who see that organizations are funded by the government will feel less inclined to contribute, since the NGO does not need (or might not even typically accept) their donation. This sets up two versions of our final hypothesis:

> **H~3a~**:  Donors will be more likely to give to legally besieged NGOs that do not receive substantial funding from government sources.
> 
> **H~3b~**:  Donors will give more to legally besieged NGOs that do not receive substantial funding from government sources.


# Methods

We test each of these hypotheses with a between-subjects vignette-based online survey experiment with 546 participants based in the United States.[^1] Most experimental and panel data on private philanthropic giving does not focus on internationally-based charities or NGOs [@KnowlesSullivan:2017], and our research design allows us to explore specific hypotheses that explain the factors that motivate international philanthropic giving.

Experiment participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online crowdsourcing platform that has been extensively used in social science research in recent years. MTurk allows researchers to recruit participants to perform tasks such as filling out surveys and opinion polls, participating in experiments, or coding the content of documents. Researchers advertise their studies as a human intelligence task (HIT) on MTurk, and participants choose only those HITs that interest them, given the promised price and estimated duration of the task. We listed a link to our survey on MTurk on March 22–23, 2018, and offered participants $0.75 for successfully completing the study.[^2]

MTurk has become an increasingly popular method for fielding survey experiments on cheap semi-representative national samples, though drawing definitive causal inference from convenience samples is not without issues. Previous research has found that MTurk workers tend to be more liberal, younger, and less racially diverse than the general US population [@CliffordJewellWaggoner:2015; @BerniskyHuberLenz:2012]. The results from our experiment mirror these findings, as seen in @tbl:descriptive-stats. 54% of our respondents are female, 63% are between 35–44 years old, 60% earn less than $60,000 a year, 55% have at least a 4-year degree, 41% never attend religious services, and only 26% identify as politically conservative.

\fingroup

However, in an impressive study to test the validity of experiments conducted on non-representative, internet-based samples, @MullinixLeeperDruckman:2015 ran 20 identical experiments on both MTurk and on a nationally representative population sample. The results from both types of surveys tracked closely with each other and MTurk-based surveys were able to replicate most of the treatment effects found in national samples. Accordingly, they concluded that internet-based population samples are "useful testing grounds for experimental social science" and that they can still lead to substantial progress in generating knowledge and making inferential claims [@MullinixLeeperDruckman:2015, 124]. MTurk-based studies ultimately do not replace the need for more robust nationally representative samples, which still provide the most robust and accurate evidence for causal claims, but they are a cost-effective method for estimating potential population-level effects. Other research corroborates these conclusions—while MTurk samples are not perfectly representative, they are still helpful approximations of representativeness [@BerniskyHuberLenz:2012; @KrupnikovLevine:2014; @CliffordJewellWaggoner:2015; @CoppockLeeperMullinix:2018].

To help ensure the quality of the responses we received and filter out workers who try to get through the HIT as quickly as possible without reading the questions [@BerinskyMargolisSances:2014], we included two attention check questions in the experiment. The first check was the second question in the survey and involved reading several sentences and following instructions to select specific responses. We designed this question to filter out shirking respondents, and we omitted participants who failed this question from our data. We included a second, simpler check later in the survey, to ensure that participants were still engaged. Only two participants did not pass this check. We include these in our analysis, but check for an effect of noncompliance in robustness checks.

Our study consisted of two stages: an experimental vignette and a set of control questions measuring participant demographics and attitudes towards philanthropy.[^3] In the experimental section of the study we presented participants with a short paragraph with three manipulated frames, each highlighting different factors that might influence patterns of private philanthropy. The vignette thus results in three manipulated variables: (1) crackdown vs. no crackdown, (2) humanitarian assistance vs. human rights, and (3) government funding vs. private funding. We used the International Rescue Committee (IRC) as our example international NGO because its work easily applies to each variation of the vignette. IRC provides humanitarian assistance and engages in human rights advocacy for refugees, more than a quarter of IRC's income comes from both government grants and private donation, and IRC works in some countries that have passed anti-NGO laws, such as Egypt and Turkey, as well as countries with no such laws.

> The International Rescue Committee (IRC) focuses on *{humanitarian assistance for refugees | human rights for refugees}* *{and works in countries that have recently passed laws that harshly restrict nonprofit organizations | NOTHING}*. A substantial proportion of IRC's funding comes from *{government | private}* donors.

Since we are manipulating three different variables with two possible answers, we use a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subject factorial design, with participants randomly assigned to one of eight different versions of the vignette (see @tbl:experimental-conditions). We used power analysis to determine our sample size: with the anticipation of finding a small effect size ($f^2 = 0.02$) at a 0.05 significance level with a power of 0.9, our target sample size was 527, which we then rounded up to 540 in case or error or noncompliance with the survey.

!INCLUDE "../output/tables/tbl-experimental-conditions.md"

After presenting participants with the vignette, we collect two outcome measures, which we use as our main dependent variables: (1) how likely participants would be to donate to IRC (measured with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "Extremely likely" to "Extremely unlikely"), and (2) how much participants would hypothetically donate to IRC if they had an extra $100. For ease of analysis, we collapse the likelihood question into a binary variable measuring whether the participant is likely ("Extremely likely" and "Somewhat likely") or not likely (all other responses) to donate. We also included a free response question for exploratory purposes, asking respondents to explain why they chose to donate the amount they indicated.

We test the effect of the three frames on these two outcomes by measuring the differences in the median amount donated and the median likelihood to donate across the crackdown vs. no crackdown condition. We do this by fitting three regression models with indicator variables and interaction terms for each of the conditions.[^4] We use Bayesian OLS regression for models measuring the amount donated, and we use Bayesian logistic regression for models measuring the likelihood of donation.[^5] In model specification 1, we test only for the effect of legal crackdowns on the outcome measures; in specification 2, we test for the effect of legal crackdowns on outcomes, conditioned on the issue area the NGO focuses on; and in specification 3, we test for the effect of crackdowns conditioned on both the issue area and the source of NGO funding, yielding these simplified models:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{\text{Model 1}} =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Crackdown} + \varepsilon  \\
y_{\text{Model 2}} =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Crackdown} + \beta_2 \text{Issue } + \\ 
& \beta_3 \text{Crackdown} \times \text{Issue} + \varepsilon \\
y_{\text{Model 3}} =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Crackdown} + \beta_2 \text{Issue} + \beta_3 \text{Funding } + \\ 
& \beta_4 \text{Crackdown} \times \text{Issue } + \\ 
& \beta_5 \text{Crackdown} \times \text{Funding } + \\ 
& \beta_6 \text{Issue} \times \text{Funding } + \\ 
& \beta_7 \text{Crackdown} \times \text{Issue} \times \text{Funding} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, to control for the effects of individual attitudes toward philanthropy, political ideology, education, and other demographic attributes, we rerun each model with a set of additional independent variables as robustness checks.

# Results

We present the average percent of respondents likely to donate to IRC, as well as the average amount donated across all three experimental conditions in @tbl:avg-results. To account for uncertainty in these aggregated estimates, we base our inference on predicted values drawn from the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients.[^coefs] @fig:likelihood-medians and @fig:amount-medians show the predicted median estimate in the crackdown and no crackdown frames, conditioned by the issue area and funding source frames, with 90% credible intervals around each point estimate. @fig:likelihood-diffs and @fig:amount-diffs in the appendix show the distributions of the differences in median predicted estimates and provide probabilities that these differences are greater (or less) than zero. Because differences can be either positive or negative (i.e. in some frames, the crackdown condition causes greater donations; in others it causes fewer donations), we report the probability that the difference is not equal to zero—when the median value is negative, we report the proportion of predicted values that are negative, and when the median value is positive, we report the proportion of values that are positive.

## Likelihood of donation

In general, when only looking at the difference between the crackdown and the no crackdown conditions, we find that respondents are not significantly more likely to donate to legally besieged international NGOs. As seen in the top left panel of @fig:likelihood-medians, those exposed to the crackdown condition tend to have a slightly higher probability of donating (46%) than those in the control condition (42.6%), but the difference in these medians is not significant ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.79$).[^6] We thus do not initially find evidence to support our hypothesis that crackdowns increase the likelihood of donating.

![Median likelihood of donation in control and crackdown groups, conditioned by other experimental frames](../output/figures/likelihood-medians.pdf){#fig:likelihood-medians}

We find more nuanced results when conditioning likelihood to donate on other experimental frames. The bottom left panel of @fig:likelihood-medians shows the median likelihood to donate across crackdown conditions and NGO issue area frames. Individuals have the same median propensity to donate to human rights NGOs (42–43%) regardless of whether the NGOs face legal difficulties abroad. However, individual donors are slightly more likely to donate to humanitarian assistance NGOs facing crackdown (48%) than those without legal challenges (43.6%), though again, the difference in medians is not significant ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.86$). We again find little support for our hypothesis that donors are more likely to donate to humanitarian assistance NGOs over human rights NGOs. In general, donors are equally likely to donate to both, except for a slight increase in likelihood for humanitarian NGOs facing legal challenges.

While the crackdown frame had no effect on the probability of donating to human rights NGOs alone, conditioning this finding on the source of NGO funding uncovers competing trends. As seen in the right panel of @fig:likelihood-medians, which shows the median likelihood of donation across all three experimental conditions, when individual donors know that a human rights organization receives the majority of its funding from the government, they are significantly more likely ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.975$) to donate in the absence of crackdowns (46%) than when the NGO faces legal difficulties (30%). In contrast, when donors know that an organization receives most of its funding from private sources, they are significantly more likely ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.98$) to donate when there *is* a legal crackdown (57%) than when the NGO faces no legal hurdles (40%). 

For humanitarian assistance NGOs, the source of funding appears to have no effect on the likelihood of donation across crackdown conditions. Individual donors have a 40–50% predicted probability of donating to humanitarian organizations regardless of experimental condition, with no significant differences in medians.

These results give partial support to our third hypothesis. The source of funding has little influence on the propensity to donate to humanitarian NGOs, but on average, donors are substantially more likely to give to privately-funded human rights NGOs than government-funded organizations. However, the effect of crackdowns reverses across conditions, as donors appear to both punish government-funded human rights NGOs that face legal difficulties and rally behind privately-funded NGOs facing the same legal difficulties. Many of the respondents described their reasoning for removing support for besieged government-funded organizations, explaining that "[i]f the non-profit works in countries where non-profit activities are heavily restricted there’s a good amount of waste and shortfalls in their activities and ability to assist others,"[^7] and that accordingly, they would be less likely to contribute. Others explained that they would decrease their donations to government-backed organizations because of the bad optics of legal crackdown, with one stating outright that "I'm not exactly sure what they did was right or wrong, I think it just seems bad, so I'm less likely to want to donate to them."[^8]

While donors on average appear to punish government-funded human rights organizations, they increase their support to privately funded NGOs. Many respondents explained their motivation for being more likely to donate in moralistic, normative terms, reasoning that "[t]hey [IRC] obviously need it more than I do,"[^9] or "[s]ince I was small child my parents thought me to help others,"[^10] or "I would want to do the right thing."[^11] Another explained "[t]hey [IRC] are doing good work in countries where it is tough for groups like them to operate and they need all the help they can get."[^13] Private donors thus seem to be more willing to support besieged human rights organizations when they are unencumbered by government funds. 

## Amount donated

While crackdowns do not substantially influence donors' *likelihood* to donate, it does increase the *amount* of money that respondents are willing to contribute (see the top left panel of @fig:amount-medians). Informing participants that IRC faces legal hurdles abroad increased donations by \$4 on average, an increase of 19% from the no crackdown condition ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.96$). This provides good evidence for our first hypothesis—donors appear to give more money to besieged international NGOs. 

![Median amount donated in control and crackdown groups, conditioned by other experimental frames](../output/figures/amount-medians.pdf){#fig:amount-medians}

This trend also holds true when accounting for the issue area of the NGO. As seen in the bottom left panel of @fig:amount-medians, the crackdown condition elicits higher donations for both the human rights and humanitarian assistance conditions, though with varying levels of significant. Emphasizing legal crackdown increased donations to human rights NGOs by \$2.60 above the no crackdown condition, but this difference is not substantially significant ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.8$). In contrast, crackdowns significantly boosted donations to humanitarian assistance NGOs by \$5—a 25% increase—beyond the control condition ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.945$). We find moderate support for our second hypothesis that donors give more to besieged humanitarian NGOs. In general, informing donors about crackdowns causes them to give more to humanitarian NGOs facing legal difficulties abroad.

Finally, the source of NGO funding adds more texture to these results. We previously found that donors seem to (1) punish government-funded human rights NGOs and (2) reward privately-funded human rights NGOs when they run into legal issues. This finding also applies somewhat to the amount donors give. Respondents donated \$8 more to besieged privately-funded human rights NGOs compared to the no crackdown control condition ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.975$), increasing their donations by 42%. Anecdotally, many of the respondents explained that they chose to give additional amounts to privately-funded human rights NGOs precisely because "the country limits non-profits."[^12] The punishment mechanism found previously does not translate to the amount donated—while there is a slight decrease in median donations to government-funded human rights NGOs facing crackdown, there is no significant difference compared to the control condition ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.74$).

Of all the experimental conditions, donors were the most influenced by legal crackdowns on government-funded humanitarian assistance NGOs. Emphasizing legal difficulties increased donations to these types of organizations by 67%, or more than \$12 ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.99$). The crackdown condition caused this increase despite some notable hesitation from respondents, many of whom felt that government-backed NGOs do not need or deserve private donations. For example, many respondents explained there was no need to make individual donations, since IRC "is already receiving funding from governments, so funding from private individuals doesn't seem as necessary. I'd prefer to give my money to an organization that is primarily run by private donations"[^14] or because "[m]y tax paying dollars go to the government and if the government is helping to fund it then they are in turn getting some of my money."[^15] This hesitation was not universal, however, and in aggregate most respondents chose to give substantially more. Many echoed this respondent, who identified the crackdown condition as one of the reasons for giving the full hypothetical \$100: "I believe the work of such organizations has an urgency that affects many refugees and their families. If they can function without being affected by the harsh laws against non-profits, I would want them to have as much help as possible to do their humanitarian work."[^16] In contrast, though, crackdowns had no substantial effect on the amount donated to privately-funded humanitarian NGOs ($p(\Delta \neq 0) = 0.71$). None of the respondents in these conditions mentioned the importance (or non-importance) funding sources when justifying their giving, and many explained that they would not give solely on the basis of the legal crackdown, including one who stated that they "would keep all \$100 because it would not even go to helping humanitarian efforts due to the new laws."[^17] It is possible that donors see government-funded humanitarian NGOs as more legitimate and more capable of handling difficult legal restrictions than privately-funded organizations—for instance, donors might assume that an international NGO that receives substantial money from USAID would ostensibly have have the backing and support of the US government when facing legal challenges, while an INGO funded by small donors would be less able to confront such challenges. Further research is needed to probe this trend.

## Effects of demographics and attitudes towards philanthropy

Our statistical modeling and analysis thus far has been aimed at confirming (or disproving) our hypotheses, and our randomized factorial design has allowed us to find convincing evidence for several of our propositions regarding the institutional and structural factors that influence donor behavior. However, we are also interested in how these structural experimental frames correlate and interact with individual donor traits, such as age, education, religiosity, and attitudes towards nonprofit and voluntary work. The analysis in this section is strictly exploratory, non-confirmatory, and not based in any hypotheses or theory. However, this additional analysis does serve as (1) a check of the robustness of our confirmatory models, and (2) a method for exploring avenues for future research on the structural and individual determinants of private giving.

# Discussion and conclusion

While the number of NGOs proliferated across the globe with the end of the Cold War, we are no longer at a historic high in terms of support for such civil society organizations. Numerous countries have cracked down on funding from foreign governments for domestic NGOs. Further, between the lack of a local philanthropic culture and an increasingly authoritarian approach that restricts space for domestic philanthropy, many NGOs are forced to rely on foreign private donors. But how do such donors donate to beseiged NGOs abroad? We find that legal crackdowns on NGOs have a moderate effect on the probability that a donor gives money, with a significant positive effect in only one condition—donors are more likely to donate to privately funded human rights NGOs that are legally besieged. Though crackdowns do not have a strong effect on the likelihood to donate, we find that already-likely donors tend to give substantially more to legally restricted NGOs, in particular those that work on humanitarian issues generally, privately-funded human rights organizations, and government-funded humanitarian organizations.



THIS NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE: Since this survey focuses on donations by citizens rather than institutional donors, it is not reflective of the average donor dollar. However, it is important to note that Americans are driving much of this private philanthropy. As Daniel Runde pointed out in a statement before a US Senate subcommittee on multilateral institutions, "U.S. philanthropy is significant [for global philanthropic efforts] but it is mainly Ms. Smith and Mr. Johnson, [n]ot Mr. and Mrs. Gates" [-@Runde:2017].



Our results have important implications for understanding donor behavior, as well as for the sustainability of civil society organizations in developing countries. INSERT IMPLICATIONS FOR DONOR BEHAVIOR.

The results of this study also make us optimistic about the prospects for substainability of domestic civil society organizations abroad. Even if these groups operate in countries that restrict funding from foreign governments, these groups can adapt their organizational structures in a way that makes them more resistant to government reperesssion. One way to do that is by transitioning to membership-based models. For instance, in India, organizations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace are registered as domestic organizations that aim to fundraise domestically after restrictions on foreign government funding. Such organizations can even fundraise from private donors in neighboring countries in order to overcome restrictions on official aid. Futher, since private funders tend to be less kown by people in recipient countries compared to major governmental funders, such methods of funding are less likely to attract the ire of authoritarian governments.

[^2]: We estimated that the survey would take 5 minutes to complete and paid participants the equivalent of a $9/hour wage. On average, participants completed the survey in 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

[^4]: Typically, between-subjects factorial designs are analyzed with ANOVA. Using regression instead of ANOVA allows us to estimate differences in means and medians more easily and provides more flexibility when controlling for demographics or attitudes towards philanthropy. @tbl:coefficients-to-add in the appendix demonstrates how to add each of the terms to estimate the average for each condition.

[^5]: In both families of models, we use weakly informative prior distributions for both the coefficients and the intercepts. In the OLS models, we use a Cauchy distribution with a median of 0 and a λ of 2.5 for coefficients and a median of 0 and a λ of 10 for the intercept. Following the suggestion of @GhoshLiMitra:2017, who recommend that weak prior distributions in logistic regression models use between 3–7 degrees of freedom, we use a Student t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, a µ of 0, and a σ of 2.5 for coefficients and a σ of 10 for the intercept in our logistic regression models.

    We obtain the posterior distribution of each dependent variable with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of the coefficient parameters. We use Stan [@stan] through R [@rstan; @r-project] to generate 4 MCMC chains with 2,000 iterations in each chain, 1,000 of which are used for warmup. We use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates and use the 5% and 95% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 90% credible intervals.

[^6]: Throughout this paper, ∆ represents the median difference in the value of interest between the "no crackdown" and "crackdown" conditions in 4000 MCMC simulations (i.e. $\text{Value}_{\text{No crackdown}} - \text{Value}_{\text{Crackdown}}$).
