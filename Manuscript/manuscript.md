The January 2011 Egyptian uprisings against the Mubarak regime presented a window of opportunity for Egypt's NGOs to transform themselves into agents of democracy. Human rights organizations ramped up their work while many development NGOs embarked on projects related to politics, policy, and social change. However, just as NGOs started to take advantage of new levels of public engagement and civic freedoms, a new legislation was passed. This 2014 legislation allowed the government to block funding for NGOs and deny any requests to affiliate with international organizations, accusing such organizations of, "grand treason, conspiracy against Egypt, and carrying out foreign agendas to harm Egyptian national security." Consequently, many international donor agencies cut support for Egyptian NGOs out of concern that they would be accused of offering illegal support for NGOs (Carnegie). Such developments are not limited to Egypt and have been mirrored in many other countries across the developing world, such as India, Bolivia, and Hungary, to name a few. Between the lack of a local philanthropic culture towards these rights-based groups and the suspension of official state funds from abroad, many NGOs across developing countries are now completely dependent on private foreign donors. But how do private donors feel about donating to beseiged NGOs abroad? How do such legal restrictions on NGOs impact private donors? 

Using an innovative survey experiment, we look at the impact of state repression of NGOs on the preferences of private donors, as well as their actual behavior donating to besieged NGOs. In particular, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors' preferences and behavior based on the issue area of the organization, and the main source of its funds. We explore how this opinion varies based on whether a recipient nonprofit (1) faces legal restrictions or a government crackdown on its activities, (2) works on particular issues, such as humanitarian assistance or human rights advocacy, and (3) receives its funding from government or private sources. 

INSERT FINDINGS

This question is important for three main reasons. First, while an increasingly large amount of private philanthropy is directed towards civil society groups in developing countries, there is little research on the structural-level determinants of such giving. In 2010, U.S. philanthropy to developing countries exceeded U.S official development assistance (ODA) by almost $9 billion (hudson). By 2014, U.S. private philanthropy amounted to $43.9 billion - %15 billion of which went to international affairs. By 2016, this amount directed towards civil society groups working in international affairs increased to $22.03 billion (givingusa). While a substantive literature exists on understanding ODA and foreign aid to developing countries, we know little about the structural-level determinants of the factors that motivate ordinary individuals to donate to causes in foreign countries. 

Second, a number of NGOs working in developing countries rely on funds from private donors in Western countries. This is because governments of such countries often provide funding only for groups working in non-contentious issue areas. Further, in places where local philanthropic capacity exists, it is often directed towards charitable activities such as health, education or religious services, rather than rights or policy work that Western aid providers generally sponsor (Closing space -42). Even when domestic donors wish to donate to NGOs working in contentious areas, they are often deterred by dismal tax incentives, or threats by governments to take away business permits. 

Finally, understanding these structural-level factors of individual giving can be used to formulate policy to ensure that such organizations continue to function in many countries where they are under attacked. NGOs play an important role in consolidating democratic gains made through contentious politics and preventing reversals to authoritarian rule [@odonnellschmitter; Diamond 1987]. They also help inculcate democratic values and encourage civic participation [@putnam2000]. Without continued access to funds.........

Below, we first review existing literature on determinants of charitable-giving, highlighting the reasons why NGOs in developing countries are so reliant on foreign funds and why this funding is in jeopardy. We then elaborate on our expectations regarding private donor giving to beseiged NGOs abroad. Following this, we describe our online survey experiment. After presenting an analysis of the results, we outline the implications of our findings for XXXX.


# Private philanthropy towards NGOs: Causes and Obstacles

The vast majority of literature on charitable-giving focuses on individual-level determinants of philanthropy. In contrast, our study looks at the structural-level conditions that inhibit or encourage giving by ordinary citizens[^1]. As governments continue to increase legal restrictions on NGOs and other CSOs, the effect of these structural-level conditions may trump individual-level causes [^2]. Below, we first review these individual-level determinants of philanthropy, followed by an explanation of why private philanthropy is essential to the operation of NGOs across the developing world.

##Who donates to NGOs and why

Recent work by @bekkers2011literature has identified eight mechanisms for why people donate to charity. These mechanisms include - awareness of need, solicitation, costs and benefits, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values, and efficacy. Others have focused on the organization and mission of the NGOs, arguing that specialized NGOs attract higher private donations than highly diversified NGOs since the former's activities would align best with donor preferences [@bilodeau1997]. Finally, looking at individual-level determinants, Wiepking (2010) finds that NGOs with an international focus are more likely to receive donations from people who are older, religious, left-leaning. 

Despite the wide range of motivations that drive individuals' philanthropic habits, these studies overall find low levels of giving to overseas causes or international groups (Micklewright and Schnepf 2009, Rajan et al 2009, Atkinson et al 2012, Casale and Baumann 2015). As @casalebaumann point out, only small proportion of private donors donate to international charity because the number of recipients are often so large and generally far removed the donor. Therefore, the benefits of giving are less obvious compared to donating to a domestic charity. However, Knowles and Sullivan (2017) argue that these studies find these effects simply than because there are more domestic charities than international development charities, which overall does not constitute eveidence that people preferred to give to local causes. 

Recent experimental evidence, however, does fall in line with the expectation of the above studies that private donors are less likely to give to international NGOs. Based on an online survey experiment of 1,200 individuals, @Tremblay-BoirePrakash:2016 find that donors are more likely to donate to a charity operating locally than to a charity providing an identical service abroad. Similarly, Knowles and Sullivan (2017), based on a field experiment in New Zealand, similarly find that 71.6% of participants reveal a preference for giving to local charity, Salvation Army, rather than the international development charity, World Vision.

The above studies primarily look at individual-level determinants of giving and our study attempts to evlauate structural-level determinants that prohibit or encourage giving. Individuals can be motivated to engage in philanthropy; however, if NGOs of their choice are prevented from operating, or the target countries are engaging in a crackdown towards NGOs, these individuals may be deterred. On the other hand, private donor giving to beseiged NGOs perhaps most in line with two mechanisms outlined by @bekkers2011literature - values and efficacy.  Values -
Efficacy - Donors' belief that their donation will make a real difference.

##NGO Dependence on Foreign Funds in Developing Countries 

Across many parts of the developing world, NGOs or CSOs are dependent on foreign funds for their operations for a variety of reasons. First, citizens in many developing countries are too poor to support a local NGO community. Without the provision of foreign aid, it may be impossible for this sector to sustain itself. Second, even for countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable-giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90% of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America (Dupuy, Ron and Prakash 2012). Third, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions.

However, a number of states across the globe have increasingly placed restrictions on funding for nonprofits, especially from ODA and foundation sources. These can include various forms - this includes requirements that funds be routed through state-owned banks, abolishing tax incentives for corporations, mandating that funds from foreign sources cannot be donated towards 'political' causes [^3], and in the most extreme cases, completely prohibiting NGOs to accept any funds from foreign sources.

These restrictions have had dire consequences for nonprofits across many parts of the world. For instance, in 2011, 30,000 NGOs were registered in Egypt - 60 of which were explicitly working on the issue of human rights and were funded exclusively by international donors. (Elagati 2013). However, once Egypt began to target foreign groups such as the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center and other state and foundation sources, there was a decrease in foreign funding. Since then, private Egyptian groups, which initially attempted to fill the gap left by the the decreases in foreign funding, have been less willing to fund any projects that could attract the ire of the government (Carnegie - 330).

In other parts of the world, a lack of tax incentives for domestic donors makes nonprofits increasingly reliant on foreign private donors. For instance, in Lebanon, corporate donors can get a tax deduction of only up to a maximum of $10 (Hudson). The 2011 Act in Hungary abolished tax incentives for individuals. Finally, in Ecuador, Decree 16 in 2013 mandated that domestic donors had no tax incentives. 

Therefore, between restrictions on official state and foundation funding sources, as well as restrictions on domestic giving, many nonprofits across the developing world are becoming increasingly dependent on private foreign sources. 




# Theory

Perceptions
A number of policy and academic discussions argue that information and foreign aid or external funding of development interventions undermines domestic government legitimacy and citizen support of their own governments [@bratton1989; Fowler 1991; @brass2010].
However, dependent on issue area.
Dietrich, Mahmud, WInters - Citizens rewards their own governments for bringing in external funding for developmental interventions.
@dietrich2015 - survey experiments - HIV/AIDS program in India - treated subjects learn it was foreign funding. Null results.


# Methods
To test the above hypotheses, we conducted an online survey experiment of XXX individuals in the U.S. 


But why is this better than panel data?
Most panel data does not ask questions about or include charities that have an international focus (Knowles and Sullivan 2017)

But why should we care about giving by ordinary citizens?

Average Americans are driving much of this private philanthropy. As Runde (2017) points out, "U.S. philanthropy is significant; but it is mainly Ms. Smith and Mr. Johnson. Not Mr. and Mrs. Gates."

Table X provides a summary of the experimental groups. 


# Results and Analysis

## Caveats
Since this survey focuses on donations by citizens rather than institutional donors, it is not reflective of the average donor dollar.

Not a representative sample - how does our sample differ from the general population? What does general donor sample look like?


# Discussion
Important role played by NGOs
Question. Motivation. Survey experiment. Findings


 Our results have important implications for understanding donor behavior, as well as for the sustainability of civil society organizations in developing countries. 
 
 Adapting organizational structures in a way that makes them more resistant to government reperesssion. Transitioning to membership models. Examples - Amnesty International India, Greenpeace India
 
 Private funders tend to be less kown by people in recipient countries compared to major governmental funders.
