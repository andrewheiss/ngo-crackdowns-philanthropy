## Description

This survey was hosted on [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com) and participants were randomly sorted into one of eight variations (see [Design](design.html)).

Participants were recruited through [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and were paid \$0.75 for their response, which is equivalent to a \$9/hour wage:

```{r calculate-payment}
hourly.wage <- 9
survey.length.minutes <- 5

payment <- survey.length.minutes * (hourly.wage / 60)
payment
```
