### Abstract

State crackdown on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly
through legal restrictions on funding, has become increasingly common.
How do legal restrictions on NGOs impact patterns of private
philanthropic giving and individual donor decision-making? With reduced
funding for NGOs working on contentious issues, and an absence of
philanthropic culture in many developing countries, many NGOs rely on
funds from private donors in Western countries. Using a survey
experiment, we explore how this crackdown changes donors’ preferences
based on the issue area and funding sources of the NGO. We find that
private donors are responsive to the legal difficulties international
NGOs face abroad and are more likely to donate to legally besieged
privately funded human rights NGOs. Additionally, already-likely donors
give substantially more to legally restricted NGOs working on
humanitarian issues. We conclude by discussing the implications for the
sustainability of NGOs working abroad.
