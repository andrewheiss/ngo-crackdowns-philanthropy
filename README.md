## Abstract

State crackdown on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly
through legal restrictions on funding, has become increasingly common.
How do legal restrictions on NGOs impact patterns of private
philanthropic giving and individual donor decision-making? With reduced
funding for NGOs working on contentious issues, and an absence of
philanthropic culture in many developing countries, many NGOs rely on
funds from private donors in Western countries. Using a survey
experiment, we explore how this crackdown changes donors’ preferences
based on the issue area and funding sources of the NGO. We find that
private donors are responsive to the legal difficulties international
NGOs face abroad and are more likely to donate to legally besieged
privately funded human rights NGOs. Additionally, already-likely donors
give substantially more to legally restricted NGOs working on
humanitarian issues. We conclude by discussing the implications for the
sustainability of NGOs working abroad.

## How to download and install

You can either [download the compendium as a ZIP
file](/archive/master.zip) or use GitHub to clone or fork the compendium
repository (see the green “Clone or download” button at the top of the
GitHub page).

In order to reproduce this project, you’ll need to install the
compendium as an R package. After downloading the compendium, do the
following:

1.  Open the compendium as a project in RStudio (double click on
    `crackdownsphilanthropy.proj`).
2.  Install the **pkgbuild**, **devtools**, **rstan**, and
    **rstantools** packages, either with RStudio’s “Packages” panel or
    by running `install.packages(c("pkgbuild", "devtools", "rstan",
    "rstantools"))`
3.  Due to [strange](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstantools/issues/52)
    [incompatibilties](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/issues/822#issuecomment-441425591)
    with **roxygen2** and **rstantools**, you need to compile the Stan
    C++ binary DLLs before building the actual
    **crackdownsphilanthropy** compendium package. Run
    `pkgbuild::compile_dll()` and wait a few minutes while the Stan
    models are built.
4.  Finally, build the compendium package by clicking on the “Install
    and Restart” button in RStudio’s “Build” panel.

You should now be able to run `library(crackdownsphilanthropy)` and
reproduce all the findings in the paper (as well as the paper itself).

To reproduce the analysis, run `make build` from RStudio’s “Terminal”
panel. Open `analysis/_site/` to see the results. Run `make serve` to
serve the site at <http://localhost:7000>.

To repdocuce the paper, run `make html` or `make tex` or `make docx` or
`make paper` (for all three output formats) from the terminal. Open
`manuscript/` (or `manuscript/tex_out/` for PDFs) to see the results.

can’t backwards-license them as only MIT. Additionally, any binary files
generated by those files (i.e. the compiled Stan code) is inherently

treat everything as MIT unless a file is explicitly GPL-only.
